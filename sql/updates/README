== Database Updates ==
This folder contains SQL files which will apply required updates to your MySQL
database, whenever the MaNGOS database structure has been changed or extended.

To see if you need an update, the file names have been given a fixed structure
that should enable you to see if you need an update or not.

=== File name descriptin ===
File names are divided into two parts. First part is the revision+counter
that show commit revision that will be compatible with database after apply update.
Counter set order in sql updates apply for same revision.
The second part of the name of the database and the table that needs and update or has been added.
See an example below:

         6936_01_mangos_spell_chain.sql
         |    |  |      |
         |    |  |      |
         |    |  |      The table `spell_chain`
         |    |  |      will need an update.
         |    |  |
         |    |  Name of affected DB (default recommended name)
         |    |  Can be: characters, mangos, realmd
         |    |
         |    Counter show number of sql update in updates list for provided revision
         |    and set proper order for sql updates for same revision
         |
         MaNGOS commit revison related to sql update.

After appling this update DB compatiable with database that include this sql update.
SQL update include special protection against multiply and wrong order SQL updates apply.
So attempt apply sql update to more old DB without previous SQL update in list for targeted database 
or to DB with already applied this or later SQL update will generate error and not applied.
